# LawnmowerSim

## Goal:
```
Make the lawn tidy for your client at all costs.
```

## Story:
You are a landscaper and got a job to tidy up someone's yard for the following day. As you are tidying up the lawn all hell brakes loose and portals start ripping open in the skies, unleashing hordes of demons. In all this chaos only one thing remains on your mind, your sacred duty of presenting a beautiful lawn the next day. Defend your tidy lawn and preserve the tidyiness against all odds... Or you will not get paid.

## Scope:
- Player has 2 weapons, a weedwhacker, and his legally licensed weapons - _his fists_
- Lawn is mowable and yields points depending on its presentation
- Portals spawn randomly depending on difficulty, producing monsters who want to destroy you and this lawn
- Fend off all invaders and protect your honor as a noble landscaper
